# Solidity_Variables-
this is a small piece of solidity code that allows the user to view solidity variables and use basic functions to view these variables or interact.

in this block of solidity code we learn what variables are basic Uint a type of interger, we'll see how booleans are implemented, address and the traditional string.
note: keep in mind strings cost alot of gas, so normally they are not used as much. strings can't concatinate nor do they act the same as other high level languages.

so basically we have declaired our pragma line and added out contract and contract name in our case its set to workingWithVariables, then we use some setter functions to set my int or in our case Uint and setMyUint (uint its 0 to 255 and int is -128 to 127), setMyBool which has a default value of false, increment and decrement our Uint8 value, view address and address balance and to finish it off we have our string "hello world".
